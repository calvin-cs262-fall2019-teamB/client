# Vision Statement

Our vision is a Calvin University dating app. Sometimes students are too busy to socialize, too lazy, or are just looking for an easier way to meet people. Our app will be different from Tinder and Bumble by only allowing Calvin students to use it. The exclusivety of this app, along with the garuntee that any potential matches will be amongst the Calvin community ensures that our final product has the potential to solve this issue.

Also, users will only be able to communicate by sending and recieving Bible verses. With incorporating a Christian thought perspective, we believe that we can build and create an application that will be applicable to our peers. And while most dating apps are rather just a "Fad" instead of a "Trend" this works in our favor as we do not expect to focus on the maintenance portion of the product, as that comes after this course. 

We have chosen to make this app in Ionic Angular utilizing Typescript, an up and coming, open source, software development language. This framework is cross-compatible with both iOS and Android. This will allow our user base to be bigger, and make all potential users feel welcome to try the app.
