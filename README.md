# Vision Statement

Sometimes students are too busy to socialize or are just looking for an easier way to meet people. Our app will be different from Tinder and Bumble by only allowing Calvin students to use it. Also, users will only be able to communicate by sending and recieving Bible verses. With incorporating a Christian thought perspective, we believe that we can build and create an application that will be applicable to our peers. The user will be able to match with somebody one at a time by choosing to match or unmatch as their pictures appear on the screen. Once matched, the users can chat and communicate with eachother in a specialized chat page off the matches page. While most dating apps are rather just a "Fad" instead of a "Trend", this works in our favor as we do not expect to focus on the maintenance portion of the product, as that comes after this course. 

We have chosen to make this app in Ionic Angular. This framework is cross-compatible with both iOS and Android. This will allow our user base to be bigger, and for everyone to feel welcome to use the app.
