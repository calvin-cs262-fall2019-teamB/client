#Vision Statement

This vision lead to the idea of a Calvin dating app. With incorporating a 
Christian thought perspective, we believe that we can build and create an 
application that will be applicable to our peers. And while most dating apps are 
rather just a "Fad" instead of a "Trend" this works in our favor as we do not 
expect to focus on the maintenance portion of the product, as that comes after this 
course.
