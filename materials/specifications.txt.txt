SPECIFICATIONS OF FUTURE USER STORY IMPLEMENTATIONS

Match with other students:
	Funcionality: match with others through swipe feature
	Usability: will be on the home page, and can view them on matches page
	Reliability: don't crash, swipe is smooth
	Performance: smooth and properly adds match to list
	Supportability: will be able to test when data base is ready
	
	Comments:
		- need to be able to see other users' profiles and match with them
		- matching is done through a swiping mechanism a la Tinder
		- the actual matches will replace the dummy data on the matches page

Message other users:
	Functionality: chat with other users with Bible verses
	Usability: will have its own page and should list all people you can chat with
	Reliability: send the messages reliably, don't crash
	Performance: send messages smoothly and correctly
	Supportability: will be able to test and optimize with data base is ready

	Comments:
		- build up the chat page so that messages can be passed between users
		- the design of this can be done in the next iteration, but the actual 
			message passing is dependant on the data base

Meet new people:
	Functionality: this app will hopefully help students meet others
	Usability: will be a by-product of using the app (hopefully)
	Reliability: theorectically useable as long as the app exists
	Performance: up to the users how they interact with those whom they meet with
	Supportability: can't really test this

	Comments:
		- this resulting aspect of the app wont happen until it is in deployment
		- ideally, this app will help Calvin students meet other Calvin students

Improve the Calvin experience:
	Functionality: will help the Calvin Community grow through meeting others
	Usability: will depend on if app is running and how people use it
	Reliability: time will tell
	Performance: N/A
	Supportability: supported through the app itself

	Comments:
		- we hope that this app will help the Calvin community grow together
			and will be a fun bonding experience
		- this will mostly occur when the app is fully developed, but we as
			developers are growing together already by working together 
			on this project
